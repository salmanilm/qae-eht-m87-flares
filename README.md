# QAE-EHT-M87-Flares
Quantum Autoencoder for Event Horizon Telescope M87* Flare Detection

**Description**: Compares quantum vs classical autoencoder anomaly detection on black hole accretion disk shadows using EHT M87* data.  

## Research Question
Can a quantum autoencoder detect flares in blackhole images more accurately than a classical neural network?

**Status/Changelog**: <br />
Week 1 - Data synthesis <br />
 downloaded FITS file of M 87* from https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/681/A79#/browse <br />
 should be EHT observations taken on 2018 April 21 at band 3
 did an initial exploration of the data and made some graphs in initial_data_exploration.ipynb (in notebooks)
