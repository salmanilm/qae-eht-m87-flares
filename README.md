# QAE-EHT-M87-Flares
Quantum Autoencoder for Event Horizon Telescope M87* Flare Detection

**Description**: Compares quantum vs classical autoencoder anomaly detection on black hole accretion disk shadows using EHT M87* data.  

## Research Question
**Can a Quantum Autoencoder Detect Flares in Blackhole Images More Accurately than a Classical Neural Network? If So by How Much? (will use ROC AUC metric)**

## Status/Changelog <br />
Week 1 - Data synthesis <br />
 downloaded FITS file of M 87* from https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/681/A79#/browse <br />
 should be EHT observations taken on 2018 April 21 at band 3
 did an initial exploration of the data and made some graphs using initial_data_exploration.ipynb (graphs are in the figures folder)
